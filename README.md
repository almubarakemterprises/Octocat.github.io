<h2>Shea Butter is the fatty acid extracted from the Kernels of Vitellaria Paradoxa (Sapotaceae), which is also known as Butyrospermum.
 The Butyrospermum species is found across 19 countries across the African Savanna Zone from Senegal to Ethiopia. Shea Butter contains high level of UV absorbing 
 Tri-Terpe ne esters, including Cinnamic Acid, Tocopherols (Vitamin A & E). Shea  butter contains high concentration of unsaponifiables matter, which accounts for its healing properties. 
 Shea butter is composed of five principal fatty acids:  
Palmitic, Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic and Arachidic. The fatty acid composition is dominated by Stearic and Oleic Acids, which accounts for 75% â€“ 92% of the fatty acids composition. 
The relative proportions of these two fatty acids produces differences in Shea Butter consistency. 
The high Stearic acid content gives the Shea butter its solid consistency while the percentage of Oleic acid influences how soft or hard the Shea butter is. </h2>
